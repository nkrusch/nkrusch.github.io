I am a first year computer science doctoral student at 
[Augusta University](https://www.augusta.edu/) 
[School of Computer and Cyber Sciences](https://www.augusta.edu/ccs/), 
in Augusta Georgia. My advisor is 
[Dr. Clément Aubert](https://spots.augusta.edu/caubert/).
My [CV is here](./cv.pdf).

## Research

I work with Clément Aubert, [Thomas Seiller](https://www.seiller.org/) and 
[Thomas Rubiano](https://people.irisa.fr/Thomas.Rubiano/) on the 
[StATyC project](https://spots.augusta.edu/caubert/research/statyc). 
StATyC stands for "Static Analyses of Program Flows: Types and Certificate for 
Complexity." I have significantly contributed to refactoring and documentation 
of our implementation of pymwp, which is an implementation of mwp-analysis of 
C code in Python ([source code](https://github.com/seiller/pymwp) and 
[documentation](https://seiller.github.io/pymwp/)). I also gave a talk about 
this topic at Augusta University's Graduate Research Day in 2021 
([abstract](./posts/grd) and [presentation](https://youtu.be/J8QtGZgTOQM)).

## Teaching

I have been an adjunct instructor at Augusta University School of Computer and 
Cyber Sciences since spring 2019. I have taught the following courses:

- CSCI 1301 - Principles of Computer Programming I - since fall 2019
- CSCI 1200 - Introduction to Computers and Programming - spring, summer 2019

I am also a member of a team working on transforming [CSCI 1301 course materials](https://csci-1301.github.io/about.html).
