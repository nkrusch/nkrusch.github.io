## Research

I work with [Dr. Cl√©ment Aubert](https://spots.augusta.edu/caubert/) on the [StATyC project](https://spots.augusta.edu/caubert/research/statyc). StATyC stands for "Static Analyses of Program Flows: Types and Certificate for Complexity." I have significantly contributed to refactoring and documentation of our implementation of pymwp, which is an implementation of mwp-analysis of C code in Python ([source code](https://github.com/seiller/pymwp) and [documentation](https://seiller.github.io/pymwp/)). I also gave a talk about this topic at Augusta University's Graduate Research Day in 2021 ([abstract](./posts/grd) and [presentation](https://youtu.be/J8QtGZgTOQM)).

## Teaching

I have been an adjunct instructor at Augusta University School of Computer and Cyber Sciences since spring 2019. I have taught the following courses:

- CSCI 1301 - Principles of Computer Programming I - since fall 2019
- CSCI 1200 - Introduction to Computers and Programming - spring, summer 2019

I am also a member of a team working on transforming [CSCI 1301 course materials](https://csci-1301.github.io/about.html).
